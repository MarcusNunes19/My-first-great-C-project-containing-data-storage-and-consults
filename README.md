This is one of my university projects and also my first complex C programm, it contains an interactable menu where the user can make data storage in txt files and retrieve the data from them. Before i talk about the project i want to make clear that it wasn't coded by high level experienced programmers, but by mere people who are at their first year of university. Therefore, if you have years of programming experience you may find some verbose and inefficiently done code.

Althoug the idea was mine it's not fair to say that all the work was mine, the project was made by a group of four people, each person having an important undertaking. My part was mostly the coding of the menu using the required statements that would make our project valid, the coding of the function that checks if someone's data has all the required characters during the register process, group guiding and i also helped my mates whenever they had problems with their codes.

So? What's the project about? The ideia behind the project was to code a software for a fictional company from Santa Helena, in the state of Paran√° from Brazil, that sells bus tickets for bus travels. The main problem in that company was that they still used old ways to register and retrieve clients data, using typewriters and piles of paper. The big pile of papers not only ocuppied a large space in the company but made the consulting a slow process. To solve these problems my group and i made a software that allow the workers of that company to register clients in txt files, sell tickets to registered clients and fetch any registered information about the clients. All this done efficiently and swiftly.

If you wish to run the code you should run the executable file inside the output folder.
